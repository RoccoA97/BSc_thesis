\chapter*{Abstract}
Searching for New Physics is the primary goal of the CMS experiment at the LHC. Performing such search without relying on a
specific theory extending the Standard Model (SM) is of paramount importance but at the same time highly non-trivial. Recently,
several proposal have been made in that sense, in particular exploiting the power of modern ML techniques. The goal of this thesis is
to apply such model-independent strategies to concrete physics cases, aiming at detecting signals solely by comparing the collision
data with what predicted by the SM.
